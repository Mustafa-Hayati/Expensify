This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I created this app using [Andrew Meads's](https://github.com/andrewjmead)  **The Complete React Developer Course (w Hooks and Redux)** course.
I only used **functional components**.
I didn't add **tests** here.
